# PhysicsSimulator
<strong>Description:</strong><br />
This is a relatively basic N-dimensional Newtonian physics engine. An extremely basic video output has been implemented from scratch, but the engine was designed to be extensible to any medium of output.

<strong>Usage:</strong><br />
Several .cpp files are provided to demonstrate the capabilities of the engine. They must be compiled separately.

<strong>Non-Standard Dependencies:</strong><br />
- SDL 2.0.7 (https://www.libsdl.org/)
