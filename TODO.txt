Brazen interface classes

Definitions:
  LIN - linearly oriented component (defined by two endpoint particles)
  VOL - volumetrically oriented component (defined by N particles)

-----CORE-----
Engine/Simulator

-----MANIPULATION-----
Thruster (LIN) - applies force to itself
Actuator (LIN) - applies opposing forces to attached particles
Camera (VOL) - renders the environment in 2D from the POV of a virtual camera

-----OUTPUT-----
TapeMeasure (LIN) - outputs the distance between its endpoints
GPS - outputs the position vector of a particle
Spedometer - outputs the velocity vector of a particle
Accelerometer - outputs the acceleration vector of a particle
